Linear Contour Interpolation Project

USAGE
	Input Data: Copy initial grid point spot elevations from the bottom-left to top-right order.
		    Every new data entry must be seperated by an enter. (\n)
		ex.
			[data-entry A]
			[data-entry B]
			[data-entry C]
			[data-entry D]
		
		^ This would fill out the spot-elevations organized on a graph that would look like:
			
			 -----
			| C D |
			| A B |
                         -----
	
	Run Interpolation: See notes on grasshopper definition.

NOTE
	Grid Completeness: Grid MUST be filled with data-points. Leaving gaps in the data may result in inaccurate contour lines.
